PROJECT PROBLEM: DATA ANALYSIS OF COMPETITIVE CUSTOMER BOOKINGS, SEARCHES, AND SESSIONS

A new startup in India, "MyNextBooking".

Traveling has significantly changed thanks to technology. In the earlier days, booking journeys was a hassle. People needed to contact travel agents, get prices, and then do a lot of paperwork.

With the advent of online apps, booking tickets has become easier. However, one challenge remains: with many available apps offering bookings, there is a lot of comparison involved in getting the best price. "MyNextBooking," a new Indian startup, acts as an aggregator on top of existing platforms like Yatra, MMT, and Goibibo (all travel companies offering services such as flights, hotels, and transportation). It helps users compare prices for their upcoming journeys on its platform and redirects customers to the desired platform after they review the price. However, they need to perform extensive data analysis on the collected data.
A PYTHON ANALYST IS HIRED:

To assist in performing an in-depth analysis. The following tasks are specified:

    Use the dataset sessions.csv and booking.csv 


    Finding Distinct Counts in Datasets using Python and NumPy

To determine the number of distinct bookings, sessions, and searches from given datasets using Python and NumPy, we'll start by assuming a structure for these datasets. Since specific datasets weren't provided, we will create sample datasets for demonstration purposes and show you how to find distinct counts using NumPy.
Sample Dataset Structure

We'll assume the datasets are structured as follows:

    Bookings: An array of booking IDs.

    Sessions: An array of session IDs.

    Searches: An array of search IDs.

Creating Example Datasets

Here's how we can create example datasets for bookings, sessions, and searches:

1. Find the number of distinct bookings, sessions, and searches from the given datasets: used NumPy using datasets bookings.csv and sessions.csv
