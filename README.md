PROJECT PROBLEM: DATA ANALYSIS OF COMPETITIVE CUSTOMER BOOKINGS, SEARCHES, AND SESSIONS

A new startup in India, "MyNextBooking".

Traveling has significantly changed thanks to technology. In the earlier days, booking journeys was a hassle. People needed to contact travel agents, get prices, and then do a lot of paperwork.

With the advent of online apps, booking tickets has become easier. However, one challenge remains: with many available apps offering bookings, there is a lot of comparison involved in getting the best price. "MyNextBooking," a new Indian startup, acts as an aggregator on top of existing platforms like Yatra, MMT, and Goibibo (all travel companies offering services such as flights, hotels, and transportation). It helps users compare prices for their upcoming journeys on its platform and redirects customers to the desired platform after they review the price. However, they need to perform extensive data analysis on the collected data.
